## What is this?
The goal of this repo is to create a community-driven and open source chatbot that developers can help improve by adding their own functions, training data, and users can help by submitting data via feedback, inputs to the bot, translations & more to help.
This chat bot would be powered by artificial intelligence and would be able to communicate with people in different languages & various functions.
