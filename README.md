## What is this?
The goal of this repo is to create a community-driven and open source chatbot that developers can help improve by adding their own functions, training data, and users can help by submitting data via feedback, inputs to the bot, translations & more to help.
This chat bot would be powered by artificial intelligence and would be able to communicate with people in different languages & preform various functions.

## How can YOU help?
This is just a VERY early beta, that is written in pure JavaScript. You could help by improving / creating datasets, adding your own functions to use, HTML / CSS etc, improving the NLP procress to call functions via entity extraction etc. A major goal is for developers to easily intergate it with countless API's as needed (your own API service etc) & for developers to EASILY customize it to their own needs (such as making a chatbot for a text based adventure game or etc).
